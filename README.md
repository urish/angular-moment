Usage
-----
Include both moment.js and angular-moment.js in your application.

```html
<script src="components/moment/moment.js"></script>
<script src="components/angular-moment/angular-moment.js"></script>
```

Add the module `angularMoment` as a dependency to your app module:

```js
var myapp = angular.module('myapp', ['angularMoment']);
```

### Timeago directive
Use am-time-ago directive to format your relative timestamps. For example:

```html
<span am-time-ago="message.time"></span>
```

angular-moment will dynamically update the span to indicate how much time
passed since the message was created. So, if you controller contains the following
code:
```js
$scope.message = {
   text: 'hello world!',
   time: new Date()
};
```

The user will initially see "a few seconds ago", and about a minute
after the span will automatically update with the text "a minute ago",
etc.

### amDateFormat filter
Format dates using moment.js format() method. Example:

```html
<span>{{message.time | amDateFormat:'dddd, MMMM Do YYYY, h:mm:ss a'}}</span>
```

This snippet will format the given time as "Monday, October 7th 2013, 12:36:29 am".

For more information about Moment.JS formatting options, see the
[docs for the format() function](http://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/).

### amCalendar filter

Format dates using moment.js calendar() method. Example:

```html
<span>{{message.time | amCalendar}}</span>
```

This snippet will format the given time as e.g. "Today 2:30 AM" or "Last Monday 2:30 AM" etc..

For more information about Moment.JS calendar time format, see the
[docs for the calendar() function](http://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/calendar-time/).
